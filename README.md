# FSLidarInventory

R code to inventory USDA Forest Service lidar point cloud holdings (and other sources as well).

This code relies on the [LidarIndexR package](https://github.com/bmcgaughey1/LidarIndexR) which must be
installed from GitHub. There are installation instructions on the repo homepage. Note that package installation requires
Rtools to compile the C++ code to read LAS/LAZ file headers.
